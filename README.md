## Controllers

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

- [Single Action Controllers](#single-action-controllers)

### Single Action Controllers

If you want to create a controller with just one action, you can use `__invoke()` method and even create "invokable" controller.

Route: `Route::get('user/{id}', 'ShowProfile');`
Artisan: `php artisan make:controller ShowProfile --invokable` 

```php
class ShowProfile extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke($id)
    {
        return view('user.profile', [
            'user' => User::findOrFail($id)
        ]);
    }
}
```

- [Model all: columns](#model-all-columns)

### OrderBy on Eloquent relationships

You can specify orderBy() directly on your Eloquent relationships.

```php
public function products()
{
    return $this->hasMany(Product::class);
}

public function productsByName()
{
    return $this->hasMany(Product::class)->orderBy('name');
}
```

### Raw DB Queries: havingRaw()

You can use RAW DB queries in various places, including `havingRaw()` function after `groupBy()`.

```php
Product::groupBy('category_id')->havingRaw('COUNT(*) > 1')->get();
```

### Eloquent where date methods

In Eloquent, check the date with functions `whereDay()`, `whereMonth()`, `whereYear()`, `whereDate()` and `whereTime()`.

```php
$products = Product::whereDate('created_at', '2018-01-31')->get();
$products = Product::whereMonth('created_at', '12')->get();
$products = Product::whereDay('created_at', '31')->get();
$products = Product::whereYear('created_at', date('Y'))->get();
$products = Product::whereTime('created_at', '=', '14:13:58')->get();
```

### Increments and decrements

If you want to increment some DB column in some table, just use `increment()` function. Oh, and you can increment not only by 1, but also by some number, like 50.

```php
Post::find($post_id)->increment('view_count');
User::find($user_id)->increment('points', 50);
```

### No timestamp columns

If your DB table doesn't contain timestamp fields `created_at` and `updated_at`, you can specify that Eloquent model wouldn't use them, with `$timestamps = false` property.

```php
class Company extends Model
{
    public $timestamps = false;
}
```

### Eloquent has() deeper

You can use Eloquent `has()` function to query relationships even two layers deep!

```php
// Author -> hasMany(Book::class);
// Book -> hasMany(Rating::class);
$authors = Author::has('books.ratings')->get();
```

### Set logged in user with Observers

Use `make:observer` and fill in `creating()` method to automatically set up `user_id` field for current logged in user.

```php
class PostObserver
{
    public function creating(Post $post)
    {
        $post->user_id = auth()->id();
    }
}
```

### Soft-deletes: multiple restore

When using soft-deletes, you can restore multiple rows in one sentence.

```php
Post::withTrashed()->where('author_id', 1)->restore();
```

### Has Many. How many exactly?

In Eloquent `hasMany()` relationships, you can filter out records that have X amount of children records.

```php
// Author -> hasMany(Book::class)
$authors = Author::has('books', '>', 5)->get();
```

### Model all: columns

When calling Eloquent's `Model::all()`, you can specify which columns to return.

```php
$users = User::all(['id', 'name', 'email']);
```

## Migrations

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

- [Order of Migrations](#order-of-migrations)
- [Migration fields with timezones](#migration-fields-with-timezones)
- [Database migrations column types](#database-migrations-column-types)
- [Default Timestamp](#default-timestamp)

### Order of Migrations

If you want to change the order of DB migrations, just rename the file's timestamp, like from `2018_08_04_070443_create_posts_table.php` to`2018_07_04_070443_create_posts_table.php` (changed from `2018_08_04` to `2018_07_04`).

They run in alphabetical order.

### Migration fields with timezones

Did you know that in migrations there's not only `timestamps()` but also `timestampsTz()`, for the timezone?

```php
Schema::create('employees', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->increments('id');
    $table->string('name');
    $table->string('email');
    $table->timestampsTz();
});
```

Also, there are columns `dateTimeTz()`, `timeTz()`, `timestampTz()`, `softDeletesTz()`.

### Database migrations column types

There are interesting column types for migrations, here are a few examples.

```php
$table->geometry('positions');
$table->ipAddress('visitor');
$table->macAddress('device');
$table->point('position');
$table->uuid('id');
```

See all column types on the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/migrations#creating-columns).

### Default Timestamp

While creating migrations, you can use `timestamp()` column type with option
`useCurrent()`, it will set `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` as default value.

```php
$table->timestamp('created_at')->useCurrent();
$table->timestamp('updated_at')->useCurrent();
```

## Views

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

- [$loop variable in foreach](#loop-variable-in-foreach)
- [Does view file exist?](#does-view-file-exist)
- [Error code Blade pages](#error-code-blade-pages)
- [View without controllers](#view-without-controllers)
- [Blade @auth](#blade-auth)

### $loop variable in foreach

Inside of foreach loop, check if current entry is first/last by just using `$loop` variable.

```blade
@foreach ($users as $user)
     @if ($loop->first)
        This is the first iteration.
     @endif

     @if ($loop->last)
        This is the last iteration.
     @endif

     <p>This is user {{ $user->id }}</p>
@endforeach
```

There are also other properties like `$loop->iteration` or `$loop->count`.
Learn more on the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade#the-loop-variable).

### Does view file exist?

You can check if View file exists before actually loading it.

```php
if (view()->exists('custom.page')) {
 // Load the view
}
```

You can even load an array of views and only the first existing will be actually loaded.

```php
return view()->first(['custom.dashboard', 'dashboard'], $data);
```

### Error code Blade pages

If you want to create a specific error page for some HTTP code, like 500 - just create a blade file with this code as filename, in `resources/views/errors/500.blade.php`, or `403.blade.php` etc, and it will automatically be loaded in case of that error code.

### View without controllers

If you want route to just show a certain view, don't create a Controller method, just use `Route::view()` function.

```php
// Instead of this
Route::get('about', 'TextsController@about');
// And this
class TextsController extends Controller
{
    public function about()
    {
        return view('texts.about');
    }
}
// Do this
Route::view('about', 'texts.about');
```

### Blade @auth

Instead of if-statement to check logged in user, use `@auth` directive.

Typical way:
```blade
@if(auth()->user())
    // The user is authenticated.
@endif
```

Shorter:
```blade
@auth
    // The user is authenticated.
@endauth
```

The opposite is `@guest` directive:
```blade
@guest
    // The user is not authenticated.
@endguest
```

## Routing

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

- [Route group within a group](#route-group-within-a-group)
- [Wildcard subdomains](#wildcard-subdomains)

### Route group within a group

In Routes, you can create a group within a group, assigning a certain middleware only to some URLs in the "parent" group.

```php
Route::group(['prefix' => 'account', 'as' => 'account.'], function() {
    Route::get('login', 'AccountController@login');
    Route::get('register', 'AccountController@register');
    
    Route::group(['middleware' => 'auth'], function() {
        Route::get('edit', 'AccountController@edit');
    });
});
```

### Wildcard subdomains

You can create route group by dynamic subdomain name, and pass its value to every route.

```php
Route::domain('{username}.workspace.com')->group(function () {
    Route::get('user/{id}', function ($username, $id) {
        //
    });
});
```

## Validation

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

### Image validation

While validating uploaded images, you can specify the dimensions you require.

```php
['photo' => 'dimensions:max_width=4096,max_height=4096']
```

## Mails

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

- [Testing email into laravel.log](#testing-email-into-laravellog)
- [Preview Mailables](#preview-mailables)

### Testing email into laravel.log

If you want to test email contents in your app but unable or unwilling to set up something like Mailgun, use `.env` parameter `MAIL_DRIVER=log` and all the email will be saved into `storage/logs/laravel.log` file, instead of actually being sent.

### Preview Mailables

If you use Mailables to send email, you can preview the result without sending, directly in your browser. Just return a Mailable as route result:

```php
Route::get('/mailable', function () {
    $invoice = App\Invoice::find(1);
    return new App\Mail\InvoicePaid($invoice);
});
```

## Artisan

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

- [Artisan command parameters](#artisan-command-parameters)

### Artisan command parameters

When creating Artisan command, you can ask the input in variety of ways: `$this->confirm()`, `$this->anticipate()`, `$this->choice()`.

```php
// Yes or no?
if ($this->confirm('Do you wish to continue?')) {
    //
}

// Open question with auto-complete options
$name = $this->anticipate('What is your name?', ['Taylor', 'Dayle']);

// One of the listed options with default index
$name = $this->choice('What is your name?', ['Taylor', 'Dayle'], $defaultIndex);
```

## Factories

⬆️⬆️⬆️ [Go to top](#summary) ⬆️⬆️⬆️

- [Factory callbacks](#factory-callbacks)

### Factory callbacks

While using factories for seeding data, you can provide Factory Callback functions to perform some action after record is inserted.

```php
$factory->afterCreating(App\User::class, function ($user, $faker) {
    $user->accounts()->save(factory(App\Account::class)->make());
});
```
